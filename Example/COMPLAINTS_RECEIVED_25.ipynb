    "# The NHTSA system that generates the complaints file underwent an update during the weekend of May 16-17, 2021. The update has caused discrepancies between the contents of the complaints file between the version posted on Friday, May 15, 2021 (before the system update) and the versions posted daily since Monday, May 17, 2021 (after the system update) and continuing to date. Lookup of complaints on the NHTSA public website are unaffected.\n",

The complaint data is included in the single FLAT_CMPL.zip and the COMPLAINTS_RECEIVED_YYYY-YYYY.zip files, which contain the same data broken down into 5-year chunks by received date. Note that the format of the complaint files has not and will not change.
